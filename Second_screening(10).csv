The microvascular complications of diabetes considered in this study are diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, and diabetic nephropathy. The aim is to identify the weighted co-expressed and differentially expressed genes (DEGs), major pathways, and their miRNA, transcription factors (TFs) and drugs interacting in all the three conditions. The primary goal is to identify vital DEGs in all the three conditions. The overlapped five genes (AKT1, NFKB1, MAPK3, PDPK1, and TNF) from the DEGs and the co-expressed genes were defined as key genes, which differentially expressed in all the three cases. Then the protein-protein interaction network and gene set linkage analysis (GSLA) of key genes was performed. GSLA, gene ontology, and pathway enrichment analysis of the key genes elucidates nine major pathways in diabetes. Subsequently, we constructed the miRNA-gene and transcription factorgene regulatory network of the five gene of interest in the nine major pathways were studied. hsa-mir-34a-5p, a major miRNA that interacted with all the five genes. RELA, FOXO3, PDX1 and SREBF1 were the TFs interacting with the major five gene of interest. Finally, drug-gene interaction network elucidates five potential drugs to treat the genes of interest. This research reveals biomarker genes, miRNA, TFs, and therapeutic drugs in the key signaling pathways, which may help us, understand the processes of all three secondary microvascular problems and aid in disease detection and management.",22-Sep,2024/5/14 13:54,2024/5/14 13:54,,e26,,3,20,,Genomics Inform,,,,,,,,eng,,,Scopus,,PubMed,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36239103,co-expression analysis; diabetes nephropathy; diabetes neuropathy; diabetes retinopathy; microvascular complication; RNA-Seq transcriptome,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although electrophysiological and morphological aspects are well described, little is known about its development and progression, undermining effective therapies. Hyperglycemia and insulin signaling impairment are considered the triggering events of oxidative stress observed in the dying nerves, however there are still many gaps in the knowledge of intracellular plastic changes it generates. AIMS: In this study we aimed to evaluate the early transcriptome changes in DN when the first symptoms of the disease start to appear. MAIN METHODS: Next-Generation Sequencing of messenger RNA (RNA-Seq) of L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) four weeks post-diabetes induction in a rat model for type 1 diabetes. KEY FINDINGS: RNA sequencing found 66 transcripts differentially expressed between diabetic and control groups, related mainly to the following biological processes: inflammation, hyperalgesia/analgesia, cell growth and cell survival. Given their roles, the differentially expressed genes suggest an attempt to switch to a survival/regenerative program. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that changes in the transcriptome profile start to appear early in the course of DN and might be related to secure cell homeostasis. Hence, the present data may indicate how DRG cells are responding to hyperglycemia in its early stages and which mechanisms first fail to respond, further leading to cell damage and cell death. Early screening of cell alterations in DN might lead to more concrete targets for pharmaceutical interventions, which could more efficiently delay cell damage.",2018/7/15,2024/5/14 13:54,2024/5/14 13:54,,54-62,,,205,,Life Sci,,,,,,,,eng,,,Scopus,WOS:000434293900007,PubMed,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29750992,"Animals; Blood Glucose; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Diabetes; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetic Neuropathies; Differential expression; Ganglia, Spinal; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Hyperalgesia; Inflammation; Male; Nerve Regeneration; Neurodegeneration; Pain; Pain Threshold; Rats; Rats, Wistar; RNA-Seq analysis; RNA, Messenger; Transcriptome",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the pathogenic mechanisms of MA have not yet been fully elucidated, and there is no effective treatment. This study aims to study the potential pathogenetic mechanisms of MA and to provide targets for the therapy of MA. Methods: A single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin induced type 1 diabetes in rat models. Subsequently, rats were divided into the control group, the diabetic group without MA, and the diabetic group with MA based on weekly behavioral assays. The differentially expressed lipids in the sciatic nerve of each group were detected using untargeted lipidomics, and the differentially expressed genes in the sciatic nerve of each group were detected by transcriptomics. The pathogenesis of MA was predicted using integrated analysis and validated by immunofluorescence staining and transmission electron microscopy. Results: Untargeted lipidomics revealed the accumulation of a more severe lipid in MA rats. Transcriptomics results suggested that differentially expressed genes in MA rats were primarily related to lipid droplets and myelin sheath. Integrated analysis results indicated that the downregulation of Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) expression was closely linked to lipid metabolism disorders. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that down-regulation of CYP1A2 expression occurred in MA rats. Transmission electron microscopy results showed that more severe lipid droplet accumulation and myelin sheath degeneration occurred in MA rats. Conclusion: Our findings imply that the downregulation of CYP1A2 expression leads to disorders of lipid metabolism and further leads to lipid droplet accumulation and myelin sheath degeneration, which might ultimately lead to the development of MA. Therefore, our study contributes to promoting the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of MA and providing potential targets for the clinical treatment of MA.",2023/3/23,2024/5/14 13:54,2024/5/14 13:54,,1151340,,,14,,Front Genet,,,,,,,,eng,,,Scopus,WOS:000964595200001,PubMed,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37035728,diabetic peripheral neuropathy; lipid metabolism disorders; mechanical allodynia; transcriptomics; untargeted lipidomics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 1,873 patients diagnosed with acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive myasthenia gravis and 36,370 healthy individuals to identify disease-associated genetic risk loci. Replication of the discovered loci was attempted in an independent cohort from the UK Biobank. We also performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using expression data from skeletal muscle, whole blood, and tibial nerve to test the effects of disease-associated polymorphisms on gene expression. We discovered two signals in the genes encoding acetylcholine receptor subunits that are the most common antigenic target of the autoantibodies: a GWAS signal within the cholinergic receptor nicotinic alpha 1 subunit (CHRNA1) gene and a TWAS association with the cholinergic receptor nicotinic beta 1 subunit (CHRNB1) gene in normal skeletal muscle. Two other loci were discovered on 10p14 and 11q21, and the previous association signals at PTPN22, HLA-DQA1/HLA-B, and TNFRSF11A were confirmed.

Proposed mechanisms of neuronal damage caused by diabetes that are downstream of hyperglycemia and/or loss of insulin signaling include ischemic hypoxia, inflammation and loss of neurotrophic support. The curcumin derivative J147 is a potent neurogenic and neuroprotective drug candidate initially developed for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions associated with aging that impacts many pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy. Here, we demonstrate efficacy of J147 in ameliorating multiple indices of neuropathy in the streptozotocin-induced mouse model of type 1 diabetes. Diabetes was determined by blood glucose, HbA1c, and insulin levels and efficacy of J147 by behavioral, physiologic, biochemical, proteomic, and transcriptomic assays. Biological efficacy of systemic J147 treatment was confirmed by its capacity to decrease TNFα pathway activation and several other markers of neuroinflammation in the CNS. Chronic oral treatment with J147 protected the sciatic nerve from progressive diabetes-induced slowing of large myelinated fiber conduction velocity while single doses of J147 rapidly and transiently reversed established touch-evoked allodynia. Conduction slowing and allodynia are clinically relevant markers of early diabetic neuropathy and neuropathic pain, respectively. RNA expression profiling suggests that one of the pathways by which J147 imparts its protection against diabetic induced neuropathy may be through activation of the AMP kinase pathway. The diverse biological and therapeutic effects of J147 suggest it as an alternative to the polypharmaceutical approaches required to treat the multiple pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to diabetic neuropathy.",18-Feb,2024/5/14 13:54,2024/5/14 13:54,,26-35,,,129,,Neuropharmacology,,,,,,,,eng,,,Scopus,WOS:000419408100003,PubMed,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29122628,"AMP kinase; AMP-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; C-Reactive Protein; Curcumin; Diabetes; Diabetic Neuropathies; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Glycated Hemoglobin; Humans; Inflammation; Insulin; J147; Mice; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neural Conduction; Neuropathy; Pain Threshold; Physical Stimulation; Protein Kinases; Signal Transduction; Streptozocin; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we expand upon those results with integrated metabolomic, proteomic, and phospho-proteomic analyses to compare the molecular profiles of DRG from DPN donors and DRG from control donors without diabetes or chronic pain. Our analyses identified decreases of select amino acids and phospholipid metabolites in the DRG from DPN donors, which are important for cellular maintenance.

We evaluated genome-wide expression to identify pathways involved in DKD and DPN progression in db/db eNOS-/- mice receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS)-blocking drugs to mimic the current standard of care for DKD patients. Diabetes and eNOS deletion worsened DKD, which improved with RAS treatment. Diabetes also induced DPN, which was not affected by eNOS deletion or RAS blockade. Given the multiple factors affecting DKD and the graded differences in disease severity across mouse groups, an automatic data analysis method, SOM, or self-organizing map was used to elucidate glomerular transcriptional changes associated with DKD, whereas pairwise bioinformatic analysis was used for DPN. These analyses revealed that enhanced gene expression in several pro-inflammatory networks and reduced expression of development genes correlated with worsening DKD. Although RAS treatment ameliorated the nephropathy phenotype, it did not alter the more abnormal gene expression changes in kidney. Moreover, RAS exacerbated expression of genes related to inflammation and oxidant generation in peripheral nerves. The graded increase in inflammatory gene expression and decrease in development gene expression with DKD progression underline the potentially important role of these pathways in DKD pathogenesis. Since RAS blockers worsened this gene expression pattern in both DKD and DPN, it may partly explain the inadequate therapeutic efficacy of such blockers.",21-May,2024/5/14 13:54,2024/5/14 13:54,,e21467,,5,35,,FASEB J,Gene expression profiles of diabetic kidney disease and neuropathy in eNOS knockout mice,,,,,,,eng,,,Scopus,,PubMed,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33788970,"Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; diabetic kidney disease; Diabetic Nephropathies; Diabetic Neuropathies; diabetic peripheral neuropathy; Gene Expression Regulation; genome-wide expression; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III; RAS blockade; ras Proteins; self-organizing map; Transcriptome",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the cellular and molecular mechanisms of DPN are poorly understood, we and others have shown that altered gene expression and DNA methylation are implicated in disease pathogenesis. However, how DNA methylation might functionally impact gene expression and contribute to nerve damage remains unclear. Here, we analyzed genome-wide transcriptomic and methylomic profiles of sural nerves from T2D patients with DPN. RESULTS: Unbiased clustering of transcriptomics data separated samples into groups, which correlated with HbA1c levels. Accordingly, we found 998 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 929 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) between the groups with the highest and lowest HbA1c levels. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs and DMGs were enriched for pathways known to play a role in DPN, including those related to the immune system, extracellular matrix (ECM), and axon guidance. To understand the interaction between the transcriptome and methylome in DPN, we performed an integrated analysis of the overlapping genes between DEGs and DMGs. Integrated functional and network analysis identified genes and pathways modulating functions such as immune response, ECM regulation, and PI3K-Akt signaling. CONCLUSION: These results suggest for the first time that DNA methylation is a mechanism regulating gene expression in DPN. Overall, DPN patients with high HbA1c have distinct alterations in sural nerve DNA methylome and transcriptome, suggesting that optimal glycemic control in DPN patients is an important factor in maintaining epigenetic homeostasis and nerve function.",2020/8/12,2024/5/14 13:54,2024/5/14 13:54,,123,,1,12,,Clin Epigenetics,,,,,,,,eng,,,Scopus,WOS:000563544700001,PubMed,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32787975,"Cluster Analysis; Diabetic Neuropathies; Diabetic peripheral neuropathy; DNA methylation; DNA Methylation; Double-Blind Method; Epigenesis, Genetic; Epigenetics; Female; Gene expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; HbA1c; Human; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Transcriptomics; Type 2 diabetes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a murine high-fat diet (HFD) obesity model of PN, dietary reversal (HFD-R) to a low-fat standard diet (SD) restores nerve function and the nerve lipidome to normal. As the gut microbiome represents a potential link between dietary fat intake and nerve health, the current study assessed shifts in microbiome community structure by 16S rRNA profiling during the paradigm of dietary reversal (HFD-R) in various gut niches. Dietary fat content (HFD versus SD) was also correlated to gut flora and metabolic and PN phenotypes. Finally, PN-associated microbial taxa that correlated with the plasma and sciatic nerve lipidome and nerve transcriptome were used to identify lipid species and genes intimately related to PN phenotypes. RESULTS: Microbiome structure was altered in HFD relative to SD but rapidly reversed with HFD-R. Specific taxa variants correlating positively with metabolic health associated inversely with PN, while specific taxa negatively linked to metabolic health positively associated with PN. In HFD, PN-associated taxa variants, including Lactobacillus, Lachnoclostridium, and Anaerotruncus, also positively correlated with several lipid species, especially elevated plasma sphingomyelins and sciatic nerve triglycerides. Negative correlations were additionally present with other taxa variants. Moreover, relationships that emerged between specific PN-associated taxa variants and the sciatic nerve transcriptome were related to inflammation, lipid metabolism, and antioxidant defense pathways, which are all established in PN pathogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicate that microbiome structure is altered with HFD, and that certain taxa variants correlate with metabolic health and PN. Apparent links between PN-associated taxa and certain lipid species and nerve transcriptome-related pathways additionally provide insight into new targets for microbiota and the associated underlying mechanisms of action in PN. Thus, these findings strengthen the possibility of a gut-microbiome-peripheral nervous system signature in PN and support continuing studies focused on defining the connection between the gut microbiome and nerve health to inform mechanistic insight and therapeutic opportunities.

Proposed etiologies implicate dysfunction of nociceptive sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) induced by generation of reactive oxygen species, microvascular defects, and ongoing axonal degeneration and regeneration. To investigate the molecular mechanisms contributing to diabetic pain, DRGs were acquired postmortem from patients who had been experiencing painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and subjected to transcriptome analyses to identify genes contributing to pathological processes and neuropathic pain. DPN occurs in distal extremities resulting in the characteristic ""glove and stocking"" pattern. Accordingly, the L4 and L5 DRGs, which contain the perikarya of primary afferent neurons innervating the foot, were analyzed from five DPN patients and compared with seven controls.

To identify distinct molecular pathways regulating diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and nephropathy (DN), as well those affected by pioglitazone, we assessed DPN and DN gene transcript expression in control and diabetic mice with or without pioglitazone treatment. Differential expression analysis and self-organizing maps were then used in parallel to analyse transcriptome data. Differential expression analysis showed that gene expression promoting cell death and the inflammatory response was reversed in the kidney glomeruli but unchanged or exacerbated in sciatic nerve by pioglitazone. Self-organizing map analysis revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction was normalized in kidney and nerve by treatment; however, conserved pathways were opposite in their directionality of regulation. Collectively, our data suggest inflammation may drive large fibre dysfunction, while mitochondrial dysfunction may drive small fibre dysfunction in T2DM. Moreover, targeting both of these pathways is likely to improve DN. This study supports growing evidence that systemic metabolic changes in T2DM are associated with distinct tissue-specific metabolic reprogramming in kidney and nerve and that these changes play a critical role in DN and small fibre DPN pathogenesis.

In this study, using a variety of systems biology approaches, our aim was to identify common and distinct mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of these two complications. METHODS: Our previously published transcriptomic datasets of peripheral nerve and kidney tissue, derived from murine models of type 1 diabetes (streptozotocin-injected mice) and type 2 diabetes (BKS-db/db mice) and their respective controls, were collected and processed using a unified analysis pipeline so that comparisons could be made. In addition to looking at genes and pathways dysregulated in individual datasets, pairwise comparisons across diabetes type and tissue type were performed at both gene and transcriptional network levels to complete our proposed objective. RESULTS: Gene-level analysis identified exceptionally high levels of concordant gene expression in DN (94% of 2,433 genes), but not in DPN (54% of 1,558 genes), between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. These results suggest that common pathogenic mechanisms exist in DN across diabetes type, while in DPN the mechanisms are more distinct. When these dysregulated genes were examined at the transcriptional network level, we found that the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway was significantly dysregulated in both complications, irrespective of diabetes type. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Using a systems biology approach, our findings suggest that common pathogenic mechanisms exist in DN across diabetes type, while in DPN the mechanisms are more distinct. We also found that JAK-STAT signalling is commonly dysregulated among all datasets.

The FUSION-derived genes were then checked to determine whether they were differentially expressed in the sciatic nerve of mouse models of diabetic neuropathy. The dysregulated genes identified in the sciatic nerve were explored in the blood of patients with diabetes. RESULTS: We found that eleven out of 452 FUSION-derived genes were regulated by diabetes GWAS loci and were altered in the sciatic nerve of mouse models with early-stage neuropathy.

To gain further insight into the mechanisms by which KU-596 improved DPN, we performed transcriptomic analysis of sensory neuron RNA obtained from diabetic wild-type and Hsp70 KO mice using RNA sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis of the differentially expressed genes indicated that diabetes strongly increased inflammatory pathways and that KU-596 therapy effectively reversed these increases independent of Hsp70. In contrast, the effects of KU-596 on decreasing the expression of genes regulating the production of reactive oxygen species were more Hsp70-dependent. These data indicate that modulation of molecular chaperones by novologue therapy offers an effective approach toward correcting nerve dysfunction in DPN but that normalization of inflammatory pathways alone by novologue therapy seems to be insufficient to reverse sensory deficits associated with insensate DPN.",2015/9/16,2024/5/14 13:54,2024/5/14 13:54,,1637-1648,,9,6,,ACS Chem Neurosci,,,,,,,,eng,,,Scopus,WOS:000361505100014,PubMed,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26161583,"Animals; Bioenergetics; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Diabetic Neuropathies; diabetic neuropathy; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Energy Metabolism; Female; Ganglia, Spinal; Glycosides; HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins; inflammation; Lumbar Vertebrae; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Mitochondria; molecular chaperones; Neuroprotective Agents; oxidative stress; Oxidative Stress; Pain; Phenethylamines; Reactive Oxygen Species; RNA Seq; Sensory Receptor Cells; Transcriptome",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is associated with debilitating and long-life complications. Therefore, understanding the factors that lead to the onset and development of these complications is crucial. To our knowledge this is the first study that attempts to identify the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in T1DM complications using whole transcriptomic profiling in United Arab Emirates (UAE) patients. The present multicenter study was conducted in different hospitals in UAE including University Hospital Sharjah, Dubai Hospital and Rashid Hospital. A total of fifty-eight Emirati participants aged above 18 years and with a BMI < 25 kg/m2 were recruited and forty-five of these participants had a confirmed diagnosis of T1DM. Five groups of complications associated with the latter were identified including hyperlipidemia, neuropathy, ketoacidosis, hypothyroidism and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). A comprehensive whole transcriptomic analysis using NGS was conducted. The outcomes of the study revealed the common DEGs between T1DM without complications and T1DM with different complications. The results revealed seven common candidate DEGs, SPINK9, TRDN, PVRL4, MYO3A, PDLIM1, KIAA1614 and GRP were upregulated in T1DM complications with significant increase in expression of SPINK9 (Fold change: 5.28, 3.79, 5.20, 3.79, 5.20) and MYO3A (Fold change: 4.14, 6.11, 2.60, 4.33, 4.49) in hyperlipidemia, neuropathy, ketoacidosis, hypothyroidism and PCOS, respectively. In addition, functional pathways of ion transport, mineral absorption and cytosolic calcium concentration were involved in regulation of candidate upregulated genes related to neuropathy, ketoacidosis and PCOS, respectively. The findings of this study represent a novel reference warranting further studies to shed light on the causative genetic factors that are involved in the onset and development of T1DM complications.",2022/9/29,2024/5/14 13:54,2024/5/14 13:54,,16316,,1,12,,Sci Rep,Identification of novel differentially expressed genes in type 1 diabetes mellitus complications using transcriptomic profiling of UAE patients,,,,,,,eng,,,Scopus,WOS:000862059200061,PubMed,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36175575,"Aged; Calcium; Child; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Female; Hospitals, University; Humans; Hypothyroidism; Ketosis; Polycystic Ovary Syndrome; Serine Peptidase Inhibitors, Kazal Type; Transcriptome; United Arab Emirates; Young Adult",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing evidence suggests that factors besides hyperglycaemia contribute to PN development, including dyslipidaemia. The objective of this study was to determine differential lipid classes and altered gene expression profiles in prediabetes and T2D mouse models in order to identify the dysregulated pathways in PN. Here, we used high-fat diet (HFD)-induced prediabetes and HFD/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T2D mouse models that develop PN. These models were compared to HFD and HFD-STZ mice that were subjected to dietary reversal. Both untargeted and targeted lipidomic profiling, and gene expression profiling were performed on sciatic nerves. Lipidomic and transcriptomic profiles were then integrated using complex correlation analyses, and biological meaning was inferred from known lipid-gene interactions in the literature. We found an increase in triglycerides (TGs) containing saturated fatty acids. In parallel, transcriptomic analysis confirmed the dysregulation of lipid pathways. Integration of lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses identified an increase in diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (DGAT2), the enzyme required for the last and committed step in TG synthesis. Increased DGAT2 expression was present not only in the murine models but also in sural nerve biopsies from hyperlipidaemic diabetic patients with PN. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that abnormal nerve-lipid signalling is an important factor in peripheral nerve dysfunction in both prediabetes and T2D.This article has an associated First Person interview with the joint first authors of the paper.",2020/1/24,2024/5/14 13:54,2024/5/14 13:54,,dmm042101,,2,13,,Dis Model Mech,,,,,,,,eng,,,Scopus,WOS:000518475500014,PubMed,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31822493,"Animals; Databases, Genetic; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2; Diet, High-Fat; Disease Models, Animal; Fatty Acids; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Hyperlipidemias; Lipid Metabolism; Lipidomic; Lipidomics; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Nerve Tissue; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Peripheral neuropathy; Phenotype; Prediabetic State; RNA, Messenger; Saturated fatty acid; Sciatic Nerve; Streptozocin; Triglyceride; Triglycerides; Type 2 diabetes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have previously documented the role of glycosylation in the expression and functioning of Cav3.2 and suggested that altered glycosylation of the channel may contribute to the aberrant expression of the channel in diabetic conditions. In this study, we aimed to analyze the expression of glycan-processing genes in DRG neurons from a leptin-deficient genetic mouse model of diabetes (db/db). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that several glycan-processing genes encoding for glycosyltransferases and sialic acid-modifying enzymes were upregulated in diabetic conditions. Functional analysis of these enzymes on recombinant Cav3.2 revealed an unexpected loss-of-function of the channel. Collectively, our data indicate that diabetes is associated with an alteration of the glycosylation machinery in DRG neurons. However, individual action of these enzymes when tested on recombinant Cav3.2 cannot explain the observed upregulation of T-type channels under diabetic conditions.Abbreviations: Galnt16: Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 16; B3gnt8: UDP-GlcNAc:betaGal beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 8; B4galt1: Beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1; St6gal1: Beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase 1; Neu3: Sialidase-3.",2020/1/1,2024/5/14 13:54,2024/5/14 13:54,,132-140,,1,14,,Channels (Austin),,,,,,,,eng,,,Scopus,WOS:000522413000001,PubMed,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32233724,"Animals; calcium channel; Calcium Channels, T-Type; Cav3.2 channel; Cell Line; diabetes; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; DRG neurons; Electrophysiology; Ganglia, Spinal; Glycosylation; Humans; Male; Mice; Polysaccharides; T-type channel; transcriptome; Transcriptome",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most common but often ignored complications of diabetes mellitus that cause numbness and pain, even paralysis. Recent studies demonstrate that Schwann cells (SCs) in the peripheral nervous system play an essential role in the pathogenesis of DPN. Furthermore, various transcriptome analyses constructed by RNA-seq or microarray have provided a comprehensive understanding of molecular mechanisms and regulatory interaction networks involved in many diseases. However, the detailed mechanisms and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network of SCs in DPN remain largely unknown. METHODS: Whole-transcriptome sequencing technology was applied to systematically analyze the differentially expressed mRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs in SCs from DPN rats and control rats. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were used to investigate the potential functions of the differentially expressed genes. Following this, lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network and ceRNA regulatory network were constructed by bioinformatics analysis methods. RESULTS: The results showed that 2925 mRNAs, 164 lncRNAs and 49 miRNAs were significantly differently expressed in SCs from DPN rats compared with control rats. 13 mRNAs, 7 lncRNAs and 7 miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR and consistent with the RNA-seq data. Functional and pathway analyses revealed that many enriched biological processes of GO terms and pathways were highly correlated with the function of SCs and the pathogenesis of DPN. Furthermore, a global lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA regulatory network in DPN model was constructed and miR-212-5p and the significantly correlated lncRNAs with high degree were identified as key mediators in the pathophysiological processes of SCs in DPN. These RNAs would contribute to the diagnosis and treatment of DPN. CONCLUSION: Our study has shown that differentially expressed RNAs have complex interactions among them. They also play critical roles in regulating functions of SCs involved in the pathogenesis of DPN. The novel competitive endogenous RNA network provides new insight for exploring the underlying molecular mechanism of DPN and further investigation may have clinical application value.",2020/5/25,2024/5/14 13:54,2024/5/14 13:54,,490,,,8,,Front Bioeng Biotechnol,,,,,,,,eng,,,Scopus,WOS:000540502700001,PubMed,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32523943,competing endogenous RNA; diabetic peripheral neuropathy; lncRNA; miRNA; mRNA; RNA sequencing; Schwann cells,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
