Resent email to invite a meeting to discuss the course.

This is essentially a coursework. Initially 36 people in the chat group, and I shared the method to do literature search using key words in Pubmed, SCOPUS, and SCI, and then imported into zotero to remove duplicates https://www.zotero.org/groups/5514750/diabetic_neuropathy/ . I also taught how to screening literatures according to the abstract in several zoom meetings. 

Among these 36 people, 9 students actually did the work of searching and screening, three students each paper, their accuracy is about 80-85%. I finally checked all the 117 papers. There are two students contributed some methods of using zotero.

This literature screening takes for two weeks.

Then, I further enrolled 64 students, in total 100 people, in the chat group. I shared some online courses and answered some questions. The basic procedure is first using SRA-explorer to download the seq data, and then using fastqc to check the quality and set parameters, and then use trimmomatic or fastp to remove the adapter and low quality sequences, and then use star to map to genome, and then use feature count to generate the count table.

Due to these people using very different platforms, Linux, Windows, Mac, these are many obstacles in practice and students find their ways to install those packages and some of them writes more detailed instructions in Chinese and shared in the chat group (those students' contribution will be written as Software in the manuscript).

Until now, 20 students processed 9 datasets and generated the count table, 1/3 of them are from biology program.

Now I am checking the final work, and there are 8 students writing a literature review  https://www.overleaf.com/read/fjvjmtsqtkdq#8572f8 , and then modified to a meta-analysis according to the statistical analysis results.

We are going to do statistical analysis after I finished my visa interview.
